## Intro
OK so firstly I didn't read the task correctly so i took dino as bottom left two pixels and obstacle as a point ./
Also the attatched python code works on tinkercad well but i don't think it works normally(unless there's a library I don't know about).
## Working
On pressing A button the dino jumps up and on hitting the obstacle the screen goes white signifying that you lost./
I basically coded that whenever bits of dino == bits of obstacle consider that as out.
